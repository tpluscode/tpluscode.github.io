Ever tried running some piece of application compiled for the 64bit platform? After a few years there finally are more
and more applications fully (I think) benefiting from the extra 32 bits.

So I am exploring [OpenLink](http://openlinksw.com/) [Virtuoso](http://virtuoso.openlinksw.com), which in it's open
source variation comes as a humble downloadable zip. Runs fine on my laptop but didn't work at first on my VPS. Why?
Because msvcr100.dll was missing. The commercial flavour of this server comes with an installer, which does include all
required dependencies.

Easy though. All I needed was Visual C++ Redistributable 2010 __(x86)__, right? Right. So I downloaded, installed and it
didn't help, which left me baffled for a moment.

Time flies...

...and flies some more...

What did I realize? I was installing... __the wrong redist package__! Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable
Package __(x64)__ and all is fine.

And I was blaming OpenLink. How lame :P

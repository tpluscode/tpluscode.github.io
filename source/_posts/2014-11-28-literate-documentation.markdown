Two months ago, at the [Wroc≈Çaw .NET USer Groups][spotkanie-69], [Luca Bolognese][luca] talked about Literate Programming.

For those who don't know, Luca Bolognese is best known for being the father of Microsoft's functional language __F#__.
He currently works for Credit Suisse - the Swiss-American investment bank where he implements uber-geek algorithms for
counting a lot of money :).

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://hammett.castleproject.org">Hamilton Verissimo</a>&nbsp;currently develops a next version of Monorail, which uses a new view engine called Blade. As much as I'd love to use Monorail 3 in the (near) future, Spark is bound to stay my view engine of choice.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately Monorail 3 is a complete rewrite in F# and the current Spark won't work out of the box and a new library is needed. Thus I forked the <a href="https://github.com/castleproject/Castle.MonoRail3">Monorail3 git repository</a>&nbsp;(you can find it at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ploosqva/Castle.MonoRail3">https://github.com/ploosqva/Castle.MonoRail3</a>), where I will slowly implement features found in the current Spark for Monorail 2.x.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I will post some notes on the progress on this blog. Below is the list of current posts on that subject:</p></p>

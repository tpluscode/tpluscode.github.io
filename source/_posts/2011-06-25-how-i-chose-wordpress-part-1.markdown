Finally my blog is up. It took me ages to start it. OK, it's not only a blog but also a small CV/portfolio kind of site. 
And setting it up wasn't quite as easy as I has hoped.

I've tried a few content management systems lately and I am very much disappointed! Most of the option I tried are 
advertised to work out of the box...

## Out of the box my a**

OK. Let's point one thing out. I have been trying to install all of my CMS of choice using Microsoft's Web Platform 
Installer. Maybe it would have been different, had I just downloaded the files and tried installing manually. That I do 
not know. Still my impression is, CMS platforms for .NET simply don't work as expected. At least not those I chose.

In the next posts I will be sharing my thoughts and problems with my chosen and failed options:

* Umbraco CMS
* Kentico CMS
* n2 CMS
* DotNetNuke Community Edition
* Composite C1
* WordPress

Please note once again. I tried installing each of the above using the Microsoft Web Platform Installer. And failed.
Eventually I downloaded WordPress, set up a MySQL databse according to the 5-minute installation tutorial and voila!!
It simply works. Maybe except the need to manually set up directory write permissions but that was easy ;)

Thank you  WordPress!

<p><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Finally my blog is up. </span><span style="color: #444444; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">It took me ages to start it. OK, it's not only a blog but also a small CV/portfolio kind of site. And setting it up wasn't quite as easy as I has hoped.</span></p>
<p></div></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I've tried a few content management systems lately and I am very much disappointed! Most of the option I tried are advertised to work out of the box...</p></p>
<h2>Out of the box my a**</h2></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">OK. Let's point one thing out. I have been trying to install all of my CMS of choise using Microsoft's Web Platform&nbsp;Installer. Maybe it would have been different, had I just downloaded the files and tried installing manually. That I do not know. Still my impression is, CMS platforms for .NET simply don't work as expected. At least not those I chose.</p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the next posts I will be sharing my thoughts and problems with my chosen and failed options:</p></p>
<ul>
<li>Umbraco CMS</li>
<li>Kentico CMS</li>
<li>n2 CMS</li>
<li>DotNetNuke Community Edition</li>
<li>Composite C1</li>
<li>WordPress</li><br />
</ul></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Please note once again. I tried installing each of the above using the Microsoft Web Platform Installer. And failed. Eventually I downloaded WordPress, set up a MySQL databse according to the 5-minute installation tutorial and voila!! It simply works. Maybe except the need to manually set up directory write permissions but that was easy ;)</p><br />
Thank you &nbsp;WordPress!<!--:--></p>

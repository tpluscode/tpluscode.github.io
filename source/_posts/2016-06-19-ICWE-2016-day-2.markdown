Earlier this week I shortly wrote about the first day Research Track at [International Conference on Web Engineering](http://icwe2016.inf.usi.ch) 
which took place between June 6-7. Today it's time for day 2 (keynote included).

## Day 2

The second day ended with a lovely dinner in the restaurant and lookout point atop [Monte Brè][bre]. Although the weather
was a little flaky, everyone got a chance for some pictures of Lugano from above. Here's my panorama shot of Lugano:

Other than that, unsurprisingly, the conference research track featured a whole lot of interesting lectures, ideas and
showcases.

### The keynote - Microservices - The Hunting of the Snark

[James Lewis of ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/profiles/james-lewis) (yes, the one famous for Martin Fowler)
gave and extensive and wildly interesting talk about the state of Microservices, organizational challenges for companies
which want to try and also consultancy work at banks. As we all know, a picture is worth a thousand words, so here are
some tweet highlights from the keynote

### REST APIs: A Large-Scale Analysis of Compliance with Principles and Best Practices

Unfortunately, this one I didn't enjoy as much. [Florian Daniel](https://twitter.com/floriandanielit) showed their results
of a large scale analysis of mobile data usage around Milan. The team gathered 78 GB worth of data and calculated a number
of metrics like HTTP method usage, media types, user agents and more. An intriguing idea, but without interaction context
it is really hard to come to any conclusions about the "quality" of any single endpoint from REST perspective. Not to mention
that the dataset likely misses any encrypted traffic, which I would expect to be a significant portion. If anything, the
work is an analysis of HTTP protocol usage on the mobile web, but not really REST at all. This is quite evident when you
look closely at some of the metrics, most of which revolve around the URI (eg. presence of underscores, `api` in path, 
presence of a trailing slash, version in URI). [I find it very harmful to consider anything specific about URIs a REST
principle and best practice](../../02/rest-misconceptions-1/). 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">URI practices are so unnecessary. Come to my <a href="https://twitter.com/wsREST">@wsREST</a> talk on Thursday at 12 to hear more <a href="https://twitter.com/floriandanielit">@floriandanielit</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ICWE2016?src=hash">#ICWE2016</a> <a href="https://t.co/bW1tNi14gy">pic.twitter.com/bW1tNi14gy</a></p>&mdash; Tomasz Pluskiewicz (@tpluscode) <a href="https://twitter.com/tpluscode/status/740111148465422336">June 7, 2016</a></blockquote>

### Benchmarking Web API Quality

A similar presentation followed, in which [Erik Wittern][ewittern] presented the results of a daunting benchmarking of a
some popular public APIs including Twitter and Flickr, but also less popular services like police.co.uk. It was very 
entertaining to see how wildly some APIs differ when requested from different regions and at various time of day. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/erikwittern">@erikwittern</a> is painting a dire picture of Web API availability <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/icwe2016?src=hash">#icwe2016</a> <a href="https://t.co/1UNoTonVWO">pic.twitter.com/1UNoTonVWO</a></p>&mdash; Philipp Leitner (@xLeitix) <a href="https://twitter.com/xLeitix/status/740120861550739456">June 7, 2016</a></blockquote>

Of course one could argue that such comparison is a bit unfair. For example the aforementioned police.co.uk is likely not
intended to work smoothly from Australia but on the other hand it may of interest to someone anywhere on the globe occasionally.
The authors are aware of limitation to their method but rightly point out that it is very important to plan for availability
when designing a public API. Especially that every single tested service showed occasional peaks in latencies and even 
outages.

### MIRA: A Model-Driven Framework for Semantic Interfaces for Web Applications

Next presentation that really got my attention was [Daniel Schwabe's][ds] presentation of [MIRA][MIRA], a JavaScript tool
and RDF notation for modelling user interfaces with abstract elements, so that they can be replaced by concrete elements
on a given platform. This method addresses the volatility of the web and the shortcoming of responsive design, which will
soon be unable to cater for futuristic User Interfaces.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These are four reasons why responsive web design isn&#39;t enough. Talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/SchwabeD">@schwabed</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ICWE2016?src=hash">#ICWE2016</a> <a href="https://t.co/XuJIGz3lXt">pic.twitter.com/XuJIGz3lXt</a></p>&mdash; Tomasz Pluskiewicz (@tpluscode) <a href="https://twitter.com/tpluscode/status/740152809941827584">June 7, 2016</a></blockquote>

MIRA authors also boast their results which show that for seasoned programmers and non-developers alike it took the least
time to build a simple application using their tool. However we've seen that already, which makes me skeptical (I'm looking
at you Lightswitch!).

There is a demo available at [http://mira.tecweb.inf.puc-rio.br/](http://mira.tecweb.inf.puc-rio.br/).

### [Volatile Functionality in Action: Methods, Techniques and Assessment](http://icwe2016.inf.usi.ch/sites/icwe2016/files/slides/Darian-Frajberg.pptx)

This was another slight disappointment of that day. Darian Frajberg presented their evaluation of using various techniques
to manage volatile functionalities of an application. An example is a time-limited prices reduction on certain item on an
e-commerce platform. The problem there is that programming tools such as code weaving and regular expressions, which were
the basis for their platform are very demanding on the programmers. Even when packaged as a reusable library, such a library
would take a great effort to support and evolve. Also, the authors didn't really compare their results to real methods
used in practice. The baseline for their evaluation included naïve and unrealistice methods, which would not be used in
serious software.

### [Abstracting and Structuring Web contents for supporting Personal Web Experience](http://icwe2016.inf.usi.ch/sites/icwe2016/files/slides/Gabriela-Bosetti_WOA.pdf)

This very unassuming and slightly misleading title hides an exciting piece of software called [Web Objects Ambient][woa].
It is a Firefox extension (with a Chrome version a possibility) which allows end users to enhance web content by interacting
with elements and combining it with more data like tweets, reviews, etc. And it uses DBpedia as the source of concepts :+1:.
In case I somehow failed to convey the general idea, here's a video showing WOA in action.

Finally, there is also an [extensibility model](https://sites.google.com/site/webobjectambient/documentation), which allows
developers to extend the sidebar seen above with more powers!

### [The DireWolf Inside You: End User Development for Heterogeneous Web of Things Appliances](http://www.slideshare.net/IstvanKoren/the-direwolf-inside-you-end-user-development-for-heterogeneous-web-of-things-appliances)

Because RDF Streams are above me I'm skipping right to the last presentation of the day. Awarded the Best Vision Paper Award,
the vision by [Istvan Koren][ik] and [Ralf Klamma][klamma] ongoing effort to build a distributed End User Interface for
the Web of Things. Build with Polymer and their own peer-to-peer communication library! Again, because a picture will
explain uch better than words, here the slide showing an overview of the authors' vision.
